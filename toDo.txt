1. Fix the deduplication node loss - When a node is seen as duplicate only one pervious node link remains. 
   Both previus nodes have to be listed. - DONE

2. Adjust the evaluation according to minmax - pick the min or max rating for multi rating nodes depending on which player goes on that trurn turn.

3. Adjust the game cycle to follow along a specific path - currently decision is influenced by rating on max node on the turn
   even if the previous node did not lead to current turns state.
